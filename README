Description:
Research in robotics necessitates hardware simulations to mimic the complex interactions of a system with its environment in real world scenarios. This is especially true for multi-agent robotics researchers, where there is an unfilled market for hardware test platforms. To be published in the realm of robotics, academic papers require theoretical derivations, simulated validation, and satisfactory hardware results. Specifically, Cal Poly SLO is not a large research institution, yet research into frequent multi-agent robotics is ongoing on campus. The hardware testing component of research is historically costly, erroneous, and generally difficult. We hope to present a budget-friendly platform that can be utilized for testing a diverse set of multi-agent robotics algorithms, in house, at Cal Poly SLO. We are targeting the testing of safety-ensured formation algorithms for non-holonomic, communication deprived, leader-follower paradigms in the presence of both static and dynamic obstacles. Recent developments in a submission by Dr. Bohara and Dr. Farzan on algorithms of this sort will serve as the foundational requirement for our test bench, as this paper is lacking in hardware test results, and would be well-served by the platform that we are proposing. As such, several requirements will be derived from the simulation results of the aforementioned paper.
